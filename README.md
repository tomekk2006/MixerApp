# MixerApp
### Control the audio of apps and devices on windows.
This app is a gui version of Deej, a piece of software used to control audio devices using an arduino.
I have made this to see if I can make a native windows application.
> [!CAUTION]
> Wouldn't recomment using it. Software has many flaws and crashes frequently!
